They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Power of Nature</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preserve the Balance</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"22\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Druid</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"23\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"25\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Druids and the Gods</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p><p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p><p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","identifier":"druid","levels":5,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6sa8ebnvcovu3mwv","type":"ItemGrant","level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"9i3CcL376z5uFGgy":"","L0LtbdTmRcFM9PDv":""}}},{"_id":"mqehjdjib3pmd16p","type":"ItemGrant","level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"lZ3YA0EI3lo9Omh2":"","A79GGVtt5bwwcPmJ":""}}},{"_id":"z37cf05ovlr0n48v","type":"ItemGrant","level":4,"title":"Features","icon":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{"added":{"OiTscHbwPhpo98Y4":"","zPeeLzgCH5JlyeJJ":""}}}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ani","arc","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":["arc","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"L7k6WXIq2rvGy0gd":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"classes.html","source":"PHB","hash":"druid_phb","sourceSubclass":"XGE","hashSubclass":"druid_phb,state:sub-dreams-xge=b1","propDroppable":"subclass","filterValues":{"Source":{"TCE":1,"ERLW":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt3":0,"UAArtificerRevisited":0,"UAClassFeatureVariants":0,"UAArtificer":0,"PHB":1,"XGE":1,"UABarbarianPrimalPaths":0,"UARevisedSubclasses":0,"SCAG":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt1":0,"UA2022GiantOptions":0,"UABarbarianAndMonk":0,"UA2020SubclassesPt2":0,"UABardAndPaladin":0,"UABardBardColleges":0,"UAKitsOfOld":0,"VRGR":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt4":0,"UATheRangerRevised":0,"UA2021MagesOfStrixhaven":0,"PSA":0,"UAModernMagic":0,"DMG":1,"UAClericDivineDomains":0,"GGR":1,"UAOrderDomain":0,"UAClericDruidWizard":0,"UADruid":0,"UAThreeSubclasses":0,"UARevisedClassOptions":0,"UASidekicks":0,"UALightDarkUnderdark":0,"UAWaterborneAdventures":0,"UAFighter":0,"EGW":1,"UAGothicHeroes":0,"UA2020PsionicOptionsRevisited":0,"UAFighterRogueWizard":0,"UAFighterRangerRogue":0,"FTD":1,"UA2020SubclassesPt5":0,"UAATrioOfSubclasses":0,"UAMonk":0,"UATheMysticClass":0,"UAPaladin":0,"MOT":1,"UAPrestigeClassesRunMagic":0,"UARangerAndRogue":0,"UARanger":0,"UAModifyingClasses":0,"UA2020SubclassesRevisited":0,"UASorcererAndWarlock":0,"UASorcerer":0,"UAGiantSoulSorcerer":0,"UA2022HeroesOfKrynn":0,"PSK":0,"UAWarlockAndWizard":0,"UATheFaithful":0,"UAEberron":0,"UAWizardRevisited":0,"_isActive":true,"_totals":{"yes":11,"no":0,"ignored":51},"_combineBlue":"or","_combineRed":"or"},"Miscellaneous":{"Reprinted":2,"Sidekick":2,"SRD":0,"Basic Rules":0,"_isActive":true,"_totals":{"yes":0,"no":2,"ignored":2},"_combineBlue":"or","_combineRed":"or"},"Other/Text Options":{"isDisplayClassIfSubclassActive":false,"isClassFeatureVariant":true,"_isActive":false}},"isPrimaryClass":true,"isDirectImport":true}}},{"_id":"aRzG2fKpwdNuuzWu","name":"Circle of Dreams","type":"subclass","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"mb-2 ve-flex-col\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms.
